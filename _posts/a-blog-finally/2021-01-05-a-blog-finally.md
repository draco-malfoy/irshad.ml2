I like both reading and writing, and I consider myself an avid *blog-reader* (is that even a thing?).

I've always wanted to blog but never got enough time to do so.

But today here I'am with this very first blog, in my writing journey. I expect myself to write atleast one blog a week.

I intend to write blogs related to my learning, tech, life-happenings etc.
