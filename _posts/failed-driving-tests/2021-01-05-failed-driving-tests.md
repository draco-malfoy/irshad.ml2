Seems like I don't ought to get a driving license, because I've being trying to get one since the past 1.5 years.

*Seriously?* You might wonder, *"1.5 years for a two wheeler license, ...in India"*

Yes, that's my case.

It is a very known fact that obtaining a driving license *easily* in India just costs a few more dollars from your pocket, but you are ensured to *get one* without any hassles. <br/> This is so known that there's a full ~40 page publication by Harvard University titled <a href='https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/remahanna/files/1_qje_driving_license.pdf' target='_blank'>'Obtaining a Driver's license in India: An Experimental Approach to Studying Corruption'</a>

Despite this, I wasn't able to get one.

Here's a broad timeline from the day I first filled the form:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Aug-2019</td>
<td>Filled license form</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nov-2019</td>
<td>Appeared for learner's license test (passed)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Apr-2020</td>
<td>Couldn't take the driving license test due to ongoing COVID, and the learner's license (6 months valid) expired</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sep-2020</td>
<td>Again applied for learner's license</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jan 2021</td>
<td>Gave my first driving license test (failed)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feb 2021</td>
<td>Gave my re-test of driving license test (failed)</td>
</tr>
</table>

I have my next re-test date appointment on 5th of April, and if I don't clear it this time I would have to go through the entire process of obtaining a driving license again, because the learner's license expires after 6 months of issue date.

Wish me luck!
